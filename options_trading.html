          leftExplanation:
            "This is smart investing! A call option lets you profit if a stock goes up, but you only lose the small premium you paid if it doesn't. It's like paying a small fee to reserve the right to buy something at today's price even if it gets more expensive later. You're making calculated risks with limited downside.",
          rightExplanation:
            "This is gambling, not investing. Scratch-offs have terrible odds (usually you lose 50-70% of what you spend). The lottery is designed to take your money, not help you build wealth. Instead of hoping to get lucky, learn to make your money work for you through real investments.",

          leftExplanation:
            "Pyramid schemes always collapse! They make money by recruiting new people, not selling real products. The only people who profit are those at the top who started early. By the time you hear about a 'great opportunity,' you're likely to lose your money when it inevitably falls apart.",
          rightExplanation:
            "This is an advanced but legitimate strategy. You collect money upfront and keep it if the stock doesn't fall below your chosen price. It's like being paid to promise you'll buy something if it gets cheaper. However, this requires good research and understanding of the risks involved.",

          rightExplanation:
            "Expensive sneakers are terrible investments. They lose most of their value immediately and continue depreciating.

          rightExplanation:
            "'At the money' means the option's strike price equals the current stock price. These options are often good starting points because they're not too expensive but have decent potential for profit if the stock moves in your favor.",

            "Impulse spending destroys wealth-building opportunities. That birthday money could be the start of an investment account that grows over time.
